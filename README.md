# Kaist Summer Session 2018

This is a repository for the KAIST Summer Session 2018 - Research Design for Data Analytics [June 2018 - August 2018].
* See [the session website](https://sites.google.com/view/kaist-mis-session2018) for detailed curriculum

## Introduction
* Instructor: [Jiyong Park](https://jiyong-park.github.io/), PhD Candidate at KAIST (jiyong.park@kaist.ac.kr)

* This session DOES NOT aim to learn a series of analytics techniques, rather DOES aim to learn what technique applies to what question, pursuing "the right tool for the right question."
* This session covers the research design for data analytics in academic research, rather than practical applications, by integrating applied econometrics, data analytics, and machine learning into a single framework.

* This session is designed with three modules.
	1. Module 1: (Lecture) Research Design for Data Analytics
	2. Module 2: (Hands-on) Causal Inference with STATA
	3. Module 3: (Hands-on) Deep Learning with PyTorch
